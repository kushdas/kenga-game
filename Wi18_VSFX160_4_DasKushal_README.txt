Maya MASH "Kenga" Game

WHAT IS "KENGA"?

The goal of the game is to remove blocks from a tower 18 blocks high without knocking it over. 
The last player to remove a block without the tower falling is the winner of the game.

BEFORE YOU PLAY

Before you start the game, be sure to take the picture file, "mash-kenga-banner.jpg", and put it 
inside your Icons folder. This can be found by clicking on your year number (ex:2018) > prefs > icons. 

HOW TO PLAY

To start the game, press "New Game". This will build the full tower without any blocks removed.

Next, use the slider to choose which block you want to remove. After selecting a block number, 
hit the "Remove Block" button to remove it.

If you try to remove a block that you have already removed, the game will give you a message 
saying that you already removed that block. In order to continue, You must choose another 
block.

You can simulate the turn by pressing play on the timeline. 

NOTE: Because this is a simulation, after pressing play you must rewind to frame 1 or you must
let the animation loop through at least once. 

The blocks on the ground plane around the tower will tell you how many turns have passed, as they 
are the bricks that were removed from the tower.

NOTE: For a better playing experience, after each turn press "7" on your keyboard for lighting 
and make sure you have turned off your grid. These are not neccessary for the game, but will 
make the game look better in your viewport.
